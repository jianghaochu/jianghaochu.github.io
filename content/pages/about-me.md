Title: About Me
 
Hi, I'm Jianghao!

I am a data scientist specialized in economic modelling and business analytics. I received my Ph.D. in Economics
 and M.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, Riverside in June 2019.
 
This site is mainly aimed to record some of my personal interests and learning experience for my future reference.
It would be my great pleasure if any of the information shared here can be of use to someone else. 

Please feel free to reach out to me at jianghaochu@gmail.com if you have any questions!
