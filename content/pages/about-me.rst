About Me
========

Hi, I'm Jianghao!

I am a data scientist specialized in economic modeling and business analytics. I received my Ph.D. in Economics, M.S.
in Applied Mathematics and M.A. in Economics from the University of California, Riverside and my B.S. in Finance from
Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
 
This site is mainly aimed to record some of my personal interests and learning experience for my future reference.
It would be my great pleasure if any of the information shared here can be of use to someone else. 

I am working on an open source Python project ``EconLib`` to provide access to adaptable
source code for econometric methods. The majority of the source code are written 
in basic Python syntax with the use of fundamental scientific computing packages such as ``NumPy``,
``SciPy`` and ``Pandas``. The package is aimed to act as a learning material for
numerical implementation of econometric methods as well as a starting point for implementing and testing
new econometric methods in Python (with little consideration of the efficiency of the program).

Please feel free to reach out to me at jianghaochu@gmail.com if you have any questions!
