    "1. Always synchronize your branches before starting any work on your own.\n",
    "2. Make changes that are self-contained.\n",
    "3. Avoid having very large changes that modify a lot of different things. (Try to make changes as small as possible as long as they're self-contained.)\n",
    "4. When working on a big change, it makes sense to have a separate feature branch.\n",
    "5. Regularly merge changes made on the master branch back onto the feature branch.\n",
    "6. Have the latest version of the project in the master branch, and the stable version of the project on a separate branch.\n",
    "7. You shouldn't rebase changes that have been pushed to remote repos.\n",
    "8. Write commit messages.\n",
    "9. Only edit the same branch when necessary after submitting a pull request.\n",
