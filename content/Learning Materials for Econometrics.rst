Over the years, I have used a number of books for Econometrics,
statistics and machine learning either as a student, teaching assistant
or lecturer. The books that I still keep hard copies with me are
Econometric Analysis by William H. Greene, Time Series Analysis by James
D. Hamilton and Introductory Econometrics by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge. The
first two are great reference books for econometric theory and the last
one comes very handy when looking for small economic datasets. Even
though I enjoy reading hard copies more, but I am more and more inclined
to have electronic copies when overall cost of carry is considered.
Given that more and more electronic books can be freely accessible
online, I feel that there is little incentive to have a hard copy if you
do not already own one. Below is a list of openly accessible books that
I find really helpful.
